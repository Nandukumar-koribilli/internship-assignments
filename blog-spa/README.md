# Blog SPA with Data Fetching

This is a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches and displays a list of blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API, ensuring smooth navigation and interactive UI updates.

## Features
- **Navigation**: Smooth client-side routing between Home and Posts pages using React Router.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetches blog posts from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Displays a loading message while fetching data.
  - Shows an error message if the API call fails.
  - Allows users to toggle post details (show/hide the post body).
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive layout.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository** (or create the project structure manually):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
