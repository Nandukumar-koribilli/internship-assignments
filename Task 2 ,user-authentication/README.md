# User Authentication Form

## Features
- **Login Form**: Validates email format and ensures password is at least 6 characters long. Any valid email and password combination is accepted for login.
- **Add User Form**: After successful login, users can add new users with similar validation rules.
- **Single File**: Combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one portable `index.html` file.
